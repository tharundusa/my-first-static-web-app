        <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
        <p>
          The most fundamental software or any app development is to select
          which is the right front end framework or library to go with. The
          market has a wide variety due to the wide range of problems that
          developers face every day. For front end development,react.js is
          playing a vital role and creating new opportunities for developers to
          build new apps .This paper talks about how react.js is helping in the
          building those application and what advantages it is having in
          building the front end. With more than 1,400 developers and over
          92,000 sites making use of React.js to build their websites it
          wouldn't be an overstatement to call React the future of front-end
          development. After all, companies like Facebook, PayPal, utilize this
          JavaScript-based UI library for a major part of their application’s
          front-end developmentfor web as well as mobile. In this paper, the key
          features comprising this library was analyzed and its advantages over
          other frameworks was also analyzed.

        <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>
          When React came into the picture, Angular was the only and major
          contender in the JS framework space. While Angular was a complete and
          proper framework, it was very difficult for developers as they had to
          do a lot of coding. Even seasoned JavaScript developers, found it
          difficult to code and they were looking for some alternative to solve
          their solution. Angular.JS was never the most desirable way to build
          JS applications. It has more functionalities and those were not needed
          by most developers. React.js came and it revolutionized the way web
          applications are developed. However, React isn’t an MVC framework as
          Angular is. It is only library. That is, React.js doesn’t include
          state managers, routers, and API managers in the core library. It may
          look like a limitation but for React developers, but this is only the
          best in making website as code is very easy to understand with all
          components and other things. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate
          the suitability of the react.js frameworks available for the
          development of web applications as well as mobile.

        <p>
          Axios is among the most popular when it comes HTTP clients for both
          browsers and Node.js. It’s simple, lightweight and easy to use it for
          customization. Not only that, but works great with React and many
          other frameworks that are found to do the sending of requests and
          responses. Axios provides support for request and response
          interceptors, transformers and auto-conversion to JSON. It’s also
          protecting us by default against cross-site request forgery, so in a
          way it is safe too. We can do the following things using Axios
          basically .Some of them are noted below:-

        <h2>3. ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>3.1 Analyzed framework</h3>
            <p>Comparison would be made of the two most common JavaScript front end Frameworks, and dominance of react.js continues to rise over the years. The following figure displays the rating of all accessible JavaScript frameworks
            </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>3.2 React VS Angular</h3>
            <center><img src="images/Fig2.png" alt="Angular vs React"></center>
            <p>
                Javascript is one of the most popular and easier languages among all the developers nowadays. There are a lot of developers, and they love to build their application, project and web related thing using script but still there is a confusion when they have to pick up right framework or library for their project. Angular and React.js is the topmost priority for all but still, most of them can’t decide between both on which one would be good for their project. Freshers want to know which one is easy to learn and since with less functionalities React.js is easier as it has more demand in the market and developers want to learn something which is easier and faster to code.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>React js</strong> is a library and not a framework to build interactive user-interfaces. On the other hand <strong>Angular</strong> is a complete framework.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Angular is a complete framework which requires a lot of learning to be done and developers must put in a lot of effort. In advance topic, it requires to learn change detection etc. On the other hand, React.Js is just a library and so it is having fewer topics and easier to learn as compared to Angular. React uses JSX (Javascript XML) which is a way of writing HTML into JavaScript. React provides flexibility and developers can learn quickly using this.</li><br>
                <li><strong>server side rendering</strong> is yet another important advantage for some type of React.js implementations using Axios etc whereas it is a
                    bit difficult to connect to server using Angular.js</li><br>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> Angular works on Real DOM. Angular follows bidirectional data flow also it is larger in size with a lot of memory(92K B) in comparison of React. React on the other hand works on Virtual DOM which is a lightweight copy of a Real DOM size(46KB ) of React is smaller than Angular.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Downloads:</strong>  Everywhere popularity of react is better and is having more downloads as compared to angular which is a complete framework with all the functionalities needed by users or developers.</li><br>
                <li> <strong>SEO:</strong> Relatively better SEO in comparison with angular
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Binding:</strong> React.js has 2-way binding data property and Angular.js has 1-way binding property</li><br>
                <li><strong>TypeScript vs JavaScript/Flow:</strong>React uses JavaScript, a dynamically-typed language (which means you don’t have to define the variable’s type). Because many developers already know and love JavaScript, this can be seen as a pro. Conversely, Angular uses Typescript which is old and not favored that much by the users or developers</li><br>
                <li> <strong>Mobile solutions</strong> of React are usually better than Angular
                </li><br>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>3.3 React Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library used to build reusable UI components. open sourced by Facebook in.</p>
            <strong>Some of the reasons for choosing react as the front End development are as follows:-</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to learn as we can quickly build things</li><br>
                <li>It helps us build a rich interface as poorly looking interface wouldn’t look good.</li><br>
                <li>Faster development and can be used to earn money faster too. Productivity is an important factor and React is definitely exhaling in that case as well</li><br>
                <li>It is trusted by great companies and all these companies uses React to build their websites. One of the well known companies is Netflix itself</li><br>
                <li>It has got strong community support and the number of downloads exceeds Angular</li><br>
                <li>It is one of the trending topics and everyone is keen on the development too.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <strong>Some disadvantages along with all advantages are as follows:-
            </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Need to import libraries for state and model as React doesn’t implement MVC and also is not having a complete structure 
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    React moves away from class-based modules and can be an obstacle for Object Oriented Programming and developers may not be relaxed with that.
                </li><br>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>3.4 The Virtual Dom in React</h3>
            <p>Some manipulations in DOM does a job on increasing the web app’s performance regardless of how fast the client platform and the JavaScript engine is and these manipulations are extremely useful.
            </p>
            <center><img src="images/Fig3.jpg" alt="Virtual Dom" ></center>
            <p>The DOM has a tree like structure and changes on top may affect the bottom and this will create a problem on giving delay to UI responses and affecting the user experience React solves the problem with a layer of the Virtual DOM between the user layer and actual DOM fortunately. The Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the DOM and rather than staying on the screen, it stays on the memory. The changes made on the Virtual DOM is taken care by an algorithm which is made and determines which changes must has to be made to the real DOM and, thus, the user's screen. Virtual DOM absorbs any changes to the DOM and keeps them in memory. The algorithm then detects on which component the change was made and updates that part of the DOM. This change will be reflected on the user's screen without disturbing the other components.

      <section id="discussion_identifier">
        <h2>4. DISCUSSION</h2>
        <p>The analysis show that the different frameworks like Angular.js and library like React well based on the following application criteria:.
            React is feasible framework for applications because of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Better learning</li><br>
                <li>Binding is better</li><br>
                <li>Good number of downloads</li><br>
                <li>Better SEO</li><br>
                <li>Applications that require versatility</li> <br>    
                <li>That require high speed </li><br>
            </ul>    
                <p>Angular is less suitable though for applications. Still some of the reasons why angular should be chosen are:-</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is having a good structure</li><br>
                <li>Applications having dynamic content are better suitable with angular.js Virtual Dom in React is a concept which is important to increase the performance of the webpage by doing some Manipulations. It is one of the many advantage of React and is a really important concept</li> <br>
            </ul>

        <h2>5. CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>This paper examined the use of react is primary for the front end technologies and for the creation Web applications. The front end frameworks React and Angular were compared and React was definitely a better choice. React was discussed in details and its advantages and disadvantages were listed too. The criteria for selection of specific framework were clearly identified and react should be chosen in most of the cases. Also, one more concept was discussed as well that is nothing but The Virtual Dom in react and its advantages on how it increases the performance of the UI and also reduces the delay.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I included the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag to signal to the browser that the document is written in HTML.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt; tag informs the browser about the document's language and serves as the starting point for the HTML document.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Using &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; ensures proper character encoding, which is essential for displaying text correctly and handling special characters.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The &lt;title&gt; tag sets the website's title, and in my case, I've titled it "LAB2."
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The &lt;head&gt; tag acts as a container for meta and title tags, where I've placed tags like &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;, &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;, and &lt;title&gt;.
                </li><br>
                <li>The &lt;body&gt; tag contains the main content of the HTML page, encompassing text, images, videos, and more. There should be only one &lt;body&gt; tag. Within it, I've utilized two &lt;article&gt; tags—one for the chosen paper's content and another for the Addendum. I've further structured the content into eight sections, with the fourth section employing &lt;div&gt; tags for further content organization.
                </li><br>
                <li>&lt;article&gt; tags are employed to encapsulate content that can stand alone and be distributed independently from the rest of the site. I've used two &lt;article&gt; tags—one for the main body content and another for the Addendum.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The &lt;header&gt; tag, nested within an &lt;article&gt; tag, is used to specify the introductory content of that article. In my case, the first article's introductory content is its heading, marked with &lt;h1&gt;.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    &lt;section&gt; tags are employed to group related content within a web page, helping to structure the page into distinct sections. I've divided the body content into sections like ABSTRACT, INTRODUCTION, RELATED WORK, and ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY, each containing subheadings.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    &lt;h1&gt; tags are used to define headings, with their hierarchy indicating their importance, rather than specifying their size. I've used &lt;h1&gt; for both the main document heading and the Addendum heading.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The &lt;center&gt; tag is used to center-align content. I've employed it for centering two &lt;h1&gt; tags ("REACT.JS AND FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT" and "ADDENDUM") and for centering images on the webpage.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    &lt;p&gt; tags are utilized to structure content into paragraphs. While I've divided content into multiple sections, I've used &lt;p&gt; tags within sections to display text data.
                </li><br>
                <li>The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to display images in the HTML document. Images are stored in the images folder, and I've specified the image file's path in the src attribute.
                </li><br>
                <li>To emphasize specific keywords, I've used the &lt;strong&gt; tag, making the text bold. We could use &lt;b&gt; but it is deprecated. So in html5 we use &lt;strong&gt; tag.
                </li><br>
                <li>For italicized text, such as author names and their information in citations, I've employed the &lt;em&gt; tag to provide special emphasis. We could use &lt;i&gt; tag but again same as &lt;b&gt; tag it is deprecated.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    &lt;div&gt; tags are akin to &lt;section&gt; tags but lack semantic meaning. I've used them to subdivide content further within section 3.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The &lt;ul&gt; tag is used to create unordered lists, typically with bullet points. Inside &lt;ul&gt;, I've used &lt;li&gt; tags to create bullet points for each item in the list.
                </li><br>
                <li>In the same way &lt;ol&gt; tag is used to created ordered lists,typically with serial numbers.In the same way we use &lt;li&gt; tags to create serial number for each item in the list. In this website I have used ordered list in only addendum section to display the content.</li><br>
                <li>There are some characters like &lt;,&gt; etc., if we want to print these characters we have to use &special_character;. For example, if we want to print less than symbol, replace special character by lt shortcut. And for greater than symbol we use gt. Likewise, there are shortcuts for many special characters and we can obtain them from this website <a href="https://www.htmlquick.com/reference/character-entity-reference.html",target="_blank">CHARACTER ENTITY REFERENCE</a> </li><br>
                <li>I have also used the tag &lt;br&gt; to break the line. I used this tag after every list item of both unordered and ordered lists. I have used this because to have a clear understanding of the points in the list. If I dont use, it is looking like a paragraph. So that is the reason for me to use break line tag for every list item of list </li><br>
                <li>I've incorporated the &lt;a&gt; tag to create hyperlinks in my HTML document. These links allow users to navigate to other websites or different sections of the same page. To ensure a seamless browsing experience, I've added the target="_blank" attribute to specific links. This attribute instructs the browser to open the linked content in a new browser tab when users click on it.For easy navigation within my webpage, I've utilized the id attribute. This attribute assigns unique identifiers to specific sections or elements within the HTML document. Users can jump directly to these sections by clicking on corresponding links provided at the top of the page.To enable users to return to the top of the page without manually scrolling, I've included a link at the bottom of the document. When clicked, this link directs users to the top part of the page.</li>
